        Your dream is the reason for the way you are. Your dream is not a coincidence. Your dream IS who you are. You SHOULD pursue it! Your dream gives you a sense of meaning and purpose, and drives you on into your chosen future. Your dream IS the meaning of your life! Get your dreams off the shelf! Focus. Strive. This is how things were meant to be. What you are dreaming of accomplishing in your life is God’s way of getting you involved in his Master Plan.
  
        Everybody has goals and dreams. These dreams are at the center of who you really are. It is the core essence of who you are as a person, and the very purpose of your BEING. What you are dreaming of accomplishing in your life is God’s way of getting you involved in his Master Plan. You were gifted with a set of dreams and talents, in the hope that you would act out these passions, follow your dreams and thusly move forward in life.
        
        It’s really a great pity that we’ve been told already since early childhood that we should stop dreaming and start “living.” What a mistake! Living IS dreaming! This is exactly why we are here: to pursue our dreams! Not for selfish reasons, but for the sake of everybody. By following MY dreams, I am becoming a better person, a happy person, shining brightly like a sun, lightening up the lives of those around me. If I decide to forget about my dreams, then I will become like a plant without water or sunlight, leaves hanging down, begging for water and looking rather miserable. Am I of any help to myself or to the world when I abandon my dreams?
        
        Your dream is the reason for the way you are! Your dream is not a coincidence. Your dream IS who you are. You SHOULD pursue it! Your dream gives you a sense of meaning and purpose, and drives you on into your chosen future. Your dream IS the meaning of your life!
        
        Why then does it seem to be so difficult to follow your dream? First, because of the anti-dream-program running in your head, a program installed when you were just a kid. Second, because your dream is always outside of your comfort zone. Pursuing your dream requires conscious effort, growth and change; this can feel somewhat uncomfortable in the beginning. You may experience some fears and worries, but this is normal. Don't focus on the fear, but focus on the dream. This way the dream becomes more important to you than the fear. Spending your life in fear and worry surely isn’t part of the Master Plan.
        
        Ask yourself this question: “What do I really want? Realizing my dreams, or getting stuck in my fears? Do I choose to follow my dream and harvest satisfaction, freedom, happiness and abundance? Or do I lock myself up in my room with my good old irritation, lack of energy, fear, fatigue and depression?” The choice is yours.
        
        As long as your dreams appeal more to you than your fears, you will find the energy and courage to move on.
        
        Your dream is your calling, something you HAVE to do to fulfil you. </P>
        
        COMMIT yourself to it with your entire being. Express your faith in the Master Plan. Say, "I don't know HOW I will do it, but if I just believe in it and follow my dream, then the Universe will show me, step by step, how to proceed.” Have faith, take action, and then watch what happens.
        
        Your dream is linked to your mission here on earth, your unique calling in life. The seeds of your dream have been sown in your heart and mind, and it is your job to help them grow, to develop your talents. Usually your dream will involve being of service to others to make their lives easier, better, more joyful and more beautiful. What is YOUR contribution to other’s lives? Exactly how do YOU make their lives better? What do you ADD to them? Is it beauty, joy, enthusiasm, faith, music, art, paintings, fragrance, motivation, a smile, some hope, self-esteem? What is your specialty? The key is making some contribution to the betterment of humanity.
        
        CHOOSE to follow your dream. It is your responsibility. You must do it. It’s part of God’s Plan. This is His way of helping this planet uplift it’s energy. Isn’t it wonderful? By following your dream, not only do you please yourself, but you are also uplifting the whole of humanity! If you ignore your dreams, do you realize how many people will be affected? It is God's Plan and therefore it can never be selfish.
        
        The more you pursue your dreams, the more exciting your life becomes!
        God is going to use you in ways you never imagined possible. And the only side effect is: feeling GOOD!
        
        Get your dreams off the shelf! Put your goals in front of you, and follow them. Focus. Strive. This IS what you should be doing, this IS what you are here for! You are here to dream, and to live your dreams! Live them out and live it up! This is how things were meant to be. It’s time to get back to basics. The essence of your life is your dream! What have you always been dreaming about, ever since you were a kid? Visualize it, define it, and then go for it! Become happy and share that happiness with the world.
